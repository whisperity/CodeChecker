# Since version 2.23 (August 2019), "git blame" introduced features to block
# certain commits from appearing as changes in the blame output.
#
# This file contains the list of commits that are not likely what you are
# looking for in a blame, usually mass reformatting, or renaming. Changes added
# by commits in list will be attributed to a parent commit that changed the
# affected (or nearby) lines.
#
# This file is named as such, because GitHub's web interface automatically
# recognises it by this conventional name. See the documentation for details:
#
# http://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/viewing-a-file#ignore-commits-in-the-blame-view
#
# You can, and should set this file as the default ignore file for "git blame"
# for your machine as well by running the following command in your
# working directory:
#
#     $ git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# Lines starting with # are comments and are ignored.
# Please make sure to **ALWAYS** attribute and reason why a commit shall be
# ignored, don't just dump bare SHAs into this file!
